# Authenticator-App
"This is a simple web-based authenticator app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to generate a time-based one-time password (TOTP) using a secret key and verify the OTP within a 30-second interval. The app provides a basic simulation of two-factor authentication (2FA) for security."
